			<div id="about-text">
			<p><span class="first_letter">I</span> am a Ph.D. candidate in Geography (human-environment, feminist, political) at Ohio State University, with a completed graduate minor in Women&apos;s, Gender and Sexuality Studies.</p>
			<div class="showOnClick">
			 <p>My scholarly interests include nature-society relations & political ecology, &ldquo;drug war&rdquo; geopolitics, feminist studies, socio-environmental justice, conservation & environmental change, and resource conflict in the Americas. </p>

			<p>The two main research projects that I am currently pursuing look at how, in different ways, counter-narcotics politics impact people and the environment in Bolivia and Honduras.</p>

			<p>In 2010 I earned my MA at Ohio State in geography. I earned my BA in Geography at UCLA in 2005, with a minor in political science.</p>

 			<h3>Community-based coca control, environmental change, and drug war legacies in Bolivia</h3>

 			<p>This project brings attention to Bolivia’s new approach and more generally to some of the grounded and embodied dynamics of illegal and illicit substance control.</p>

According to the United Nations, the new “social control” method of controlling coca leaf production has lead to a marked decline in net land under coca cultivation in 2011, 2012, and 2013. And yet Bolivia’s approach to what has long been the United States’ primary tactic of narcotics control in Andean South America, namely coca eradication, has gone mostly unrecognized and remains poorly understood elsewhere.</p>
			
			<p class="standalone">In order to better understand the logics behind, failures of, and possibilities for drug control reform in the Americas, this project brings attention to Bolivia’s new approach and more generally to some of the grounded and embodied dynamics of illegal and illicit substance control.</p> 

			<p>I investigate this approach in its broader geopolitical context, with an emphasis on how it affects the lives and livelihoods of coca growers and sellers who have long been impacted by international coca eradication efforts. In doing so, I investigate the intertwined processes of livelihood adaptations, shifting human-coca relations, environmental change, and the micro-politics of coca unions. </p>

We highlight the complicity of failed drug control policies in this dynamic, and argue for drug policy reform that would put an end to violent and futile militarized ‘drug war’ strategies that harm people and their homelands.</p>

			<p><span class="first_letter">A</span>fter living and working as a research assistant in Ecuador for most of 2007 and 2008, I returned for graduate research in 2009 to investigate the relationship between Waorani indigenous residents, and an oil company in Ecuador’s Yasuní National Park. In a paper currently under review I argue that oil company activities and conservation priorities in my study region were compatible in several key ways, and that this threatens Waorani belonging in their ancestral territory.</p>
