					<h3>Community-based coca control, environmental change, and drug war legacies in Bolivia</h3>

			<!-- <img width="30" src="images/research/BO.png"> -->
				
			<div>
				<p><span class="first_letter">U</span>nder reforms by coca union leader turned President Evo Morales, registered coca producers can now produce a limited amount of the culturally and medicinally important coca plant without fear of violent eradication in Bolivia. However, Bolivia’s approach to what has long been the United States’ primary tactic of narcotics control in Andean South America, namely coca eradication, has gone mostly unrecognized and remains poorly understood elsewhere. In order to better understand some of the logics behind, failures of, and possibilities for drug control reform, this dissertation project brings attention to Bolivia’s new approach and the grounded and embodied dynamics of past and present coca control.</p>

				<img src="images/research/DryingCocaYungas.jpg" alt="Drying Coca Yungas">

				<p>I investigate this approach in its broader geopolitical and colonial context, with an emphasis on how it affects the health and wellbeing of coca growers who have long been impacted by international coca eradication efforts. In doing so, I consider the intertwined processes of livelihood adaptations, shifting human-coca relations, environmental change, and the micro-politics of coca union governance. </p>

				<img src="images/research/Sacaba.jpg" alt="Sacaba">


				<p>I demonstrate that failed anti-cocaine efforts and attempts at their reform can only be fully comprehended by considering the everyday realities of social reproduction in coca cultivation areas, the role that health logics play in validating violence, and the role of multi-species relations in livelihoods based on coca in Bolivia. This project is ongoing. </p>

	 		<h3>Drug trafficking, deforestation, and dispossession in Honduras</h3>
	 			
			<p><span class="first_letter">C</span>Collaborators and I offer evidence that drug trafficking through remote forests of the Honduran Mosquitia is intensifying deforestation and the dispossession of people from their land.</p>
			
			<img alt="honduras" src="images/research/honduras-canoe.jpg">
			<p>Using a commodity chain approach, we detail the ways in which cocaine transport facilitates rent capture, resulting in a land grab and loss of native peoples' political power in the context of local political economic and livelihood formations. This work sheds light on understudied conservation and social justice outcomes of illicit capital flows in rural transit zones.</p>
			<img alt="honduras" src="images/research/honduras-village.jpg">
			<p>We highlight the complicity of failed drug control policies in this dynamic, and argue for drug policy reform that would put an end to violent and futile militarized "drug war" strategies that harm people and their homelands. Further field research, and the convening of a working group on this dynamic across Central America, is planned for 2015.</p>

			<h3>Conservation, oil extraction, and socio-environmental justice in Ecuador</h3>
				

		
			<div>
				<p><span class="first_letter">A</span>fter living and working as a research assistant in Ecuador for most of 2007 and 2008, I returned for graduate research in 2009 to investigate the relationship between Waorani indigenous residents, conservation scientists, and an oil company in Ecuador’s Yasuní National Park.</p>

				<img alt="Ecuador canoe" src="images/research/ecuador-canoe.jpg">


				<p>Drawing inspiration from critical environmental security studies and political ecology scholarship on colonial legacies of conservation practice, in a paper currently under review I argue that oil company activities and conservation priorities in my study region were compatible in several key ways, and that this may threaten Waorani belonging in their ancestral territory.</p>
