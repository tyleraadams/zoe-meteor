			<div class="">
			 <p>My scholarly interests include nature-society relations & political ecology, &ldquo;drug war&rdquo; geopolitics, feminist studies, socio-environmental justice, conservation & environmental change, and resource conflict in the Americas. </p>

			<p>The two main research projects that I am currently pursuing look at how, in different ways, counter-narcotics politics impact people and the environment in Bolivia and Honduras.</p>

			<p>In 2010 I earned my MA at Ohio State in geography. I earned my BA in Geography at UCLA in 2005, with a minor in political science.</p>
